    This example demonstrates how you can bind dynamic values.
</p>
<p>
    As a first step, you need to create a <code>bindableValue</code> &mdash; an observable object that could
    notify listeners about value changes.
</p>
<p>
    Than you can wire this object with DOM element using <code>js.bind</code> function.
</p>
<p>
    As soon as binding is configured, you can call setValue method to change the value. The change reflects in the UI immediately.
