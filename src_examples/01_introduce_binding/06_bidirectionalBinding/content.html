    This example demonstrates bi-directional binding usage.
    By default John Smith makes any binding to form elements bidirectional.
    If you wand input value wire to be unidirectional, pass this options to binding config:
</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">{ bidirectional: false }</code></pre>

<p>Note that for <code>lastName</code> custom event type is set:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">{ event: "keyup" }</code></pre>

<p>Because of this option Last Name change occur on key up instead of field leave.</p>

        <strong>John Smith does not really like bi-directional binding.</strong>
        Such kind of binding can easily lead you to bad design.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nevertheless, bi-directional wires are handy when you work with form elements (like input, textearea etc).
        But make sure you never never never listen to bindable value changes in <strong>View Model</strong> code.
        Bindable notifications are for View only! Not for View Model! If you feel you need to listen to changes in View Model,
        this probably indicates that bi-directional binding should be changed to regular binding plus regular event handler.

    <p>Note how <code>to</code> method calls chained:</p>

    <pre><code class="javascript">js.bind(/*...*/)
        .to(/* something */)
        // ...more 'to' cals can go here...
        .to(/* something */);</code></pre>

    <p>You can use these chains any time you need to bind a single variable to multiple handlers.</p>
