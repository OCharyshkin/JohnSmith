<p>
    <strong>ViewModel</strong> is an objects that acts as a mediator between business logic and view logic.
    ViewModel exposes bindable properties and functions that could be consumed by corresponding views.
</p>

<p>
    It is a common practice to declare ViewModel "classes" to handle it's logic. This example demonstrates simple
    ViewModel class that exposes only 2 bindable variables: first name and last name. In the example these variables
    are used for configuring binding but in a real application <strong>ViewModel</strong> usually works with
    <strong>View</strong> object.
