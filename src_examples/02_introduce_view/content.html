            Views are objects that work as a glue between <strong>ViewModel</strong> and HTML markup. Views consume bindable
            properties of ViewModel and wire it with corresponding DOM elements. Views could also handle DOM events and call
            ViewModel methods when these events occur.

        <p>
            Every view has a strict scope defined a by selector passed to <code>renderTo</code> method. It means that any binding
            or nested views setup will be made relatively to root View element.
